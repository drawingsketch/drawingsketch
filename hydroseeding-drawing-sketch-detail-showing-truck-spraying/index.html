<p><strong>Hydroseeding Drawing Sketch Detail Showing Truck Spraying</strong>, The first tank was applied using the turret gun with a direct spray nozzle and the other 2 tanks I used the turret gun with a fan nozzle. Hydroseeding is an efficient technique used to cost-effectively revegetate large areas that include steep slopes delivering lower prices per hectare than other techniques. Some will put the hose over their shoulder which is a very comfortable way to hydroseed.</p>

<p>This slurry is sprayed over the ground surface in a uniform layer to establish vegetation for erosion control. Hydroseeding is the process of combining seed mulch healthy soil amendments and fertilizers with water to form a thick slurry.
